# Mayfeild-County
Mayfeild County is a text based survival game I've been working on since around June of 2020. The premise is that everyone on earth but the player disappears and the player has to survive in an empty world. The player must stave off starvation, infection and wild animals, as well as keep from going insane, while looting, fishing and hunting in the abandoned township of Mayfeild County.

The project is open source, and only supports windows PC's. Written in C++.

If you don't have visual studio, or don't care about the code and just want to run the game, here's how:

1. Go to the master section on the last page (middle of the page at the left above where this readme is) and download the files, or at least just the ones that end in .exe and .wav
2. Put all the files ending in .exe and .wav in a folder together somewhere.
3. Double click the exe and the game should run.
4. Antivirus programs tend to pop up and scan the game, I'm not sure why they do that but I promise it's safe.
